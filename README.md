# BA952--Final-Paper
This is the coding for the BA952 Final Project

# 1. Code
In the code folder, we have two different set of coding

### 1.1 Climate Data Download and Cleaning

In this folder there are a set of coding that is used to downloading and cleaning the climate station data

1. NOAA Climate Data Download.Rmd is used for downloading the climate station data.

2. NOAA Climate Data Process.Rmd is used for inverse distance weighting and bins separation to generate the county level climate fluctuation

3-1. NOAA Clean.Rmd is a further process of generating the annual counted data for summary statistics and future merge, this data is the calendar year end fluctuation used for matching with the loan outcomes, since the loan data is gathered at the end of each year

3-2. NOAA Clean- June.Rmd is a process of the data by generating the annual fluctuation counted from last July to June, which will fitting with the deposit data that are generated at the end of June every year

### 1.2 FDIC Data and CRA Data Cleaning

In this folder there are a set of coding that is used to downloading and cleaning FDIC SOD, Call Report and FFEIC CRA loan data.

1. FDIC SOD Cleaning.Rmd is used to cleaning the FDIC SOD data. It will generate the branch deposit amount for future merge with climate data for regression.

2-1. CRA download.R is used to download the CRA plain data.

2-2. CRA Cleaning.R is used to cleaning the CRA data, which will save the CRA data for future merge with climate data for regression

3. FDIC Call Report.R is used to cleaning the FDIC Call report and find the default amount for different loan. It will generate the default data for future merge with climate data for regression

### 1.3 Regression

In this folder the regression part is storaged here

1. Regression.Rmd is the code we use for regression

# 2. Result

1. Result-plot.R is the code that we used to generate the 

2. Three pdf are the plots that is generated by code 1. Result-plot.R

3. results.xlsx are the data used for drawing

4. summary_statistics.xlsx storage the summary statistics and variable description which we use online converter to generate the table of statistics to tex
